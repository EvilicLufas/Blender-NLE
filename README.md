Blender-NLE
===========

These are my preset setting for the Blenders Video editing UI and keyboard shortcuts which are inspired by Final Cut Pro

Version : 1.0
History : changlog [1]

How to use
----------

In the "import these" folder you can find the two files that you can import in blender.

1 * NLEvideoInterface.blend : is for the Video Editing interface
2 * NLE_KeyPreset	    : is for the keyboard shorcuts

Open Blender and then load the (1) by going to File -> Open. Then for the (2) file open user preferences --> Input --> Import Key Configuration
