Blender NLE
=========

The Non-Linear Video Editor of [Blender] allows you to perform basic actions like video cuts and splicing, as well as more complex tasks like video masking. Check out the video tutorials (playlist) created by [Mikeycal Meyers] to learn how to use Blender as a video editor

I've created some preset settings for the Blender Video Editing UI and Keyboard Shortcuts which are mostly inspired from the commercial software Final Cut Pro

The files are located in the "import these" folder:

  - ##### NLEvideoInterface.blend : 
  the Video Editing interface
 
  - ##### NLE_KeyPreset.py :
  the keyboard shorcuts

Installation
--------------

The installation of the preset settings is easy :

- For the *Video Editing interface* just open the NLEvideoInterface.blend file from the blender file menu

```
> File -> Open
```

- For the *keyboard shorcuts* just import the NLE_KeyPreset.py file from the User Preferences

```
> File -> User Preferences --> Input --> Import Key Configuration
```

- If you want Blender to start up always in the Video Editing mode, just save the startup file

```
> File -> Save Startup File
```
