Blender NLE
=========

The Non-Linear Video Editor of [Blender] allows you to perform basic actions like video cuts and splicing, as well as more complex tasks like video masking. Check out the video tutorials created by [Mikeycal Meyers] (playlist)

I've created some preset settings for the Blenders Video editing UI and keyboard shortcuts which are inspired mostly by Final Cut Pro

  - ##### NLEvideoInterface.blend : 
  the Video Editing interface
 
  - ##### NLE_KeyPreset.py :
  the keyboard shorcuts
